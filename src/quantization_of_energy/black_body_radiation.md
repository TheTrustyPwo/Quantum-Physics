# Black Body Radiation

## Background

One phenomenon that seemed to contradict the theories of classical physics was blackbody radiation. To understand this phenomenon, it is necessary to know that all tangible bodies in the universe emit energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The amount of energy emitted by a body depends on several factors, such as temperature or color of the body. As the temperature of a body increases, the average frequency, and thereby energy, of the electromagnetic waves it emits increases as well. Hence an electric stove burner or the filament of a space heater glows dull red or orange when heated, whereas the much hotter tungsten wire in an incandescent light bulb gives off a yellowish light.

The intensity of radiation is a measure of the energy emitted per unit area. A plot of the intensity of blackbody radiation as a function of wavelength for an object at various temperatures is shown in the above figure. One of the major assumptions of classical physics was that energy increased or decreased in a smooth, continuous manner. For example, classical physics predicted that as wavelength decreases, the intensity of the radiation an object emits should increase in a smooth curve without limit at all temperatures, as shown by the broken line for 6000K. As a result, classical physics could not account for the significant decrease in the intensity of radiation emitted at shorter wavelengths, primarily in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, and this phenomenon was hence referred to as the ultraviolet catastrophe. In fact, it predicted that an infinite amount of ultraviolet radiation would be emitted.

## Quantization

In 1900, however, the German physicist Max Planck explained the ultraviolet catastrophe by proposing that the energy of electromagnetic waves is quantized rather than continuous. This means that for each temperature, there is a maximum intensity of radiation that is emitted in a blackbody object, corresponding to the peaks in the graph, so the intensity does not follow a smooth curve as the temperature increases, as predicted by classical physics. Thus energy could be gained or lost only in integral multiples of some smallest unit of energy, a quantum.

This concept is termed the Quantization of Energy. It states that, rather than being able to take on any value from a continuous series, energy is only allowed to possess specific discrete values from a set of accepted values. In this way, Planck postulated that the energy of a particular quantum of radiant energy could be described explicitly by the equation.

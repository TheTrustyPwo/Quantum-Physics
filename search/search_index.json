This theorem can help us examine the life cycle of a star in the following chapters.</p> <p>Several billion years ago, all of the mass that makes up the Sun and planets in our solar system was spread out as a low-density gas mixed with dust called a nebula. The extent of the nebula was roughly 100 times larger than the current distance between the Earth and the Sun, or $100\\;\\text{au}$.</p> <p>Which stage of the solar system has lower gravitational potential energy \u2014 the spread-out gas or our solar system today? Let's examine.</p> <p>When the spread-out region of gas collapses into a solar system, it happens spontaneously due to the force of gravity. No energy is added to the system, and energy is, in fact, released as the gases heat up and release radiation. If, after the solar system was formed, we wanted to separate the solar system back out into a diffuse gas spread out over a large region of space, it would require energy to be added by an external force pulling the solar system apart. This tells us that the original state, the nebula, had higher potential energy. A system with more potential energy can do more work. The spread-out gas distributed over a large, spherical region preceding the birth of the Sun had more potential energy than the solar system today. This potential energy is lost as the attractive force of gravity among the particles pulls inward, initiating a process called gravitational collapse. In order to arrive at this conclusion, we will need to think about whether the work done by gravity on individual gas and dust particles is positive or negative as the region of gas and dust (the nebula) contracts. Then, we can relate this work to the change in potential energy of the nebula.</p> <p>We will consider the amount of work that is done on each particle that makes up the nebula as it collapses from a radius of $100\\;\\text{au}$ to a much smaller radius\u2014say, $10\\;\\text{au}$. Work is defined as force $F$ times the distance $d$ an object is moved in the direction of the force: $W = Fd$. When the force and the displacement are in the same direction, the work is positive. Because gravity pulls each particle toward its center, and the nebula is collapsing toward its center, the total work is, in fact, a positive number: $W_{100\\;\\text{au} \\rightarrow 10\\;\\text{au}} &gt; 0$.</p> <p>Where does the energy come from to do this amount of work? Energy is conserved; it cannot be created or destroyed. Because this work is done by the gravitational force, it is equal to the amount of gravitational potential energy lost by the nebula.

This means that for each temperature, there is a maximum intensity of radiation that is emitted in a blackbody object, corresponding to the peaks in the graph, so the intensity does not follow a smooth curve as the temperature increases, as predicted by classical physics. Thus energy could be gained or lost only in integral multiples of some smallest unit of energy, a quanta.</p> <p>This concept is termed the Quantization of Energy. It states that, rather than being able to take on any value from a continuous series, energy is only allowed to possess specific discrete values from a set of accepted values.

Planck's theory of quantization was able to explain the frequency distribution of black body radiation, and it paved the way for the development of quantum mechanics.

When someone learns, discovers, or knows something by intuition, they instinctively get the gist of that thing. They get a hunch of the general but relatively vague idea or notion of the situation. Therefore, intuition is concerned with general notions, concepts, and insights. Consequently, a lot of other fundamental elements are ascribed to intuition.</p> <p>In order for intuition to understand something, it needs to form a general concept of the situation, as previously implied. A concept is not only a notion, but also a representation apprehended by the mind; i.e., a mental representation. Accordingly, intuition is also concerned with what a thing represents. When one asks what a thing represents, they are seeking to see what it is like. Therefore, another element of intuition is the fact that it seeks out connections and relations between things. Intuition can hence be described as a \u201cnetwork of insights,\u201d so to speak.</p> <p>Now, as said before, intuition is concerned with general notions. When something is notional, it exists hypothetically, speculatively, and imaginatively. This connects to my earlier point about intuition getting a hunch; it makes conjectures and hypotheses. Jung\u2019s primary claims about intuition is that it deals with possibilities, and that it apprehends images from the unconscious. What does he mean by this?</p> <p>My primary claim about the intuitive function is that it is concerned with concepts because concepts are concerned with everything that isn\u2019t necessarily realistic; that is, possibilities, notions, images, representations, hypotheses and speculations. Hence, the process of intuition is to conceive things; the process of speculating and insightfully guessing on the possible nature or essence of a situation; it\u2019s seeking to grasp the possible nature or general idea of something through guessing or hypothesizing. On its own, this process is quite immediate. People can usually just \u201cget\u201d things, but that mostly comes out of guesswork; aka, intuition.</p> <p>The intuitive function is also known to insightfully predict or anticipate future events; another reason why Jung stated that it is concerned with possibilities. It vaguely envisions things, to put it shortly. It can do this through pattern-recognition; when it sees the big-picture, a pattern can start to emerge, and hence hypotheses, guesses, and insights on future possibilities are formed. As Jung stated, \u201cintuition points to possibilities as to whence it came and wherever it is going in a given situation.\u201d And when Jung states that intuition is a perception via the unconscious, he means that intuition apprehends what is hidden or implicit in a situation, which is why it\u2019s considered insightful.</p>"},{"location":"psychology/typology/the_dichotomies/sensation_vs_intuition.html#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>So, given all of what was just stated, intuition can be defined as the perception of the possible big picture of a situation, apprehending hypotheses.

Judging functions are called judging functions because they judge stuff. Quite straightforward, but the process of judgment or judging things isn\u2019t usually considered. Forming a judgment refers to coming to a decided conclusion on something, or forming an opinion by evaluating something. Jung stated that \u201cjudgment always presupposes a criterion\u201d which is true because there needs to be a standard by which to judge something. Therefore, the underlying process of judgment refers to the formation of criteria and standards by which to form a conclusion. In short, judgement can be defined as referring to a frame of reference to make sense of things.</p> <p>Since judgment refers to a set of standards and criteria by which to judge things, it seeks to create measurements. That is, it compares information with the standard that it established, to see if the information coincides with it. It does this passively and actively. By \u2018passively\u2019, I mean the mere comparison of data with the standards and criteria; here, I am referring to evaluation. By \u2018actively\u2019, I mean the arrangement of data so as to make it coincide with the standards. The active aspect of judgement coincides more with Jung\u2019s term, which was \u2018rationality\u2019.</p> <p>That is the very reason why people in Jungian Typology refer to judgment as the organization of things. Again, Carl Jung\u2019s term for judging was \u2018rationality\u2019, which is a better term for it since it doesn\u2019t coincide with the conventional sense of the word \u201cjudgment\u201d, and rationality implies a certain orderliness. It was also called \u2018rationality\u2019 because rationality is to reason. The set of criteria is the \u201creason\u201d behind the judgment. So, judgement or rationality entails things like reasoning, evaluation, making sense of things, and consequently, order. As stated by Jung, \u201cRational judgment, ... is a force that coerces the untidiness and fortuitousness of life into a definite pattern, or at least tries to do so.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"psychology/typology/the_dichotomies/thinking_vs_feeling.html#thinking","title":"Thinking","text":"<p>So, thinking refers to judging or evaluating things through logic.

Thinking seeks to see how information coincides with standards of true or false, valid or invalid, functional or nonfunctional. Additionally, thinking is systematic, because logic is concerned with the inferential validity of systems.</p> <p>Jung referred to thinking as the use of the intellect.
